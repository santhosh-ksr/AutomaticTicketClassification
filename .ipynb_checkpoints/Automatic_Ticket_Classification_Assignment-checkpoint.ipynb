    "\n",
    "You need to build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be doing topic modelling on the <b>.json</b> data provided by the company. Since this data is not labelled, you need to apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Credit card / Prepaid card\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bank account services\n",
    "\n",
    "* Theft/Dispute reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mortgages/loans\n",
    "\n",
    "* Others \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of topic modelling, you will be able to map each ticket onto its respective department/category. You can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, you can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department."

      "this closure appears to be a deceptive way to get out of their relationship with me since they dont see my account as profitable with complete disregard for their effect on my credit and overall financial health i also have all my automatic i have to switch not to mention the fees i would have incurred from other companies if those payments bounce since i did not receive any notice it was closed they say they sent me a closure letter the same day the account was closed xxxxxxxx but then why does it not show up in the notice and letters section of online banking  see screenshots attached  like the returned payments notices do which suggests a closure notice was not actually sent to date i have not received any closure notice this to me appears to be a violation of reg z closure notice requirements a breach of contractaccount agreement and the whole issue is a possible udaap violation \n",

      "Lower Text good morning, i am wanting to advise of an issue that i was just alerted of regarding chase bank. i have xxxx accounts at this institution and my daughter was making a purchase at a retail store where her credit card was denied. i called chase to find out the issue of what was wrong and they advises that our account was in loss prevention and no are no longer wanting to do business with us. i asked why and they proceeded to tell me they do n't have to disclose a reason as they are able to close accounts when they want and the reason that they have is in an internal reason and they are not able to disclose to me why. i basically asked the representative at chase so u mean it is a big secret and he said basically yes and they will send me a check of the remaining balance in the mail in 10 days or i can go to a branch and get my money. i am at a loss for words as now i have xxxx which are accounts for a xxxx xxxx and a xxxx student where we have to figure out in a blink of an eye what our next step is. we have to stop 4 direct deposits and because what we are blue collars workers that live paycheck to paycheck and are not profitable to the bank we get the axe without any for warning. my account does not have suspicious activity. all my deposits and withdrawals are all associated with a name/place whether i use my atm card or have it directly withdrawn from my account. i work and pay bills and ensure my children 's accounts are ok and transfer money to and from of needed so everything is labeled. i think freezing someone 's account without warning is not a proper way to do business especially if we are not profitable and then proceed to say they ca n't disclose the reason why. if they feel i am doing something wrong why not advise me so it can be straightened out which is why i think it boils down to the bottom line that we are not beneficial to this xxxx dollar institution. i now need to take a day from work to go to the bank to get my money and open another account with needing to stop electronic deposits and withdrawals in a rush all because we do n't fit the ideal customer they are looking for but the business account i have my name associated with as i am a signor for our xxxx xxxx is still ok to stay open with hem because of the high balance. \n",

      "\n",
      "the next step, so says jp morgan chase, is to put a 'stop ' on the checks. after 2 hours on the phone with them, i called xxxx xxxx again to have this done, and they graciously helped with this. i called xxxx the next day after the financial markets closed ( when the 'stop ' would be processed ) to make sure that went through okay. this is when i learned that jp morgan chase had already cashed the checks two days prior to this request ( a detail that the representatives from jp morgan chase had left out during our two hours on the phone the day prior ). because jp morgan chase had cashed the checks, xxxx xxxx was unable to process a stop. \n",
      "\n",
      "after another hour on the phone with jp morgan chase, i was told to have xxxx recall the checks. i spent 30 minutes on the phone with xxxx trying to explain that i wanted the check recalled -- not stopped -- but recalled. they were confused, and didn't know how to proceed. i played ping pong with jp morgan chase and xxxx with conflicting information for the next two days before someone at jp morgan chase asked me to have xxxx 's financial institution recall the checks. xxxx, who, at this point, has no business relationship with me because jp morgan chase cashed the checks in question, could not immediately comply. \n",

      "\n",

      "Lower Text after having months of problems with errors on the part of chase bank, i decided i wanted to close my accounts. unfortunately, i have a lot of automatic payments set up through my checking account and credit card so it was going to take some time, but i started by going into a local branch and attempting to withdrawal a few thousand dollars to begin the process of opening an account at another bank. i had my driver license and my credit card with me. the bank manager said that my signatures didnt match and refused to give me any money. this was from my savings account and i didnt even have the account number so it was the tell who wrote it on the withdrawal slip. it is now the beginning of xx/xx/xxxx, almost a month later, and i have been fighting with chase, all the way up to the executive offices, to fix the problem and allow me to withdrawal my money. weeks have gone by and they dont return my calls. when i call them, there is always some sort of emergency that has kept them out of the office. one person alone had xxxx one day, a few days later her mother supposedly passed away, and then less than a week after that her son was allegedly hospitalized with some deadly xxxx. during the last week of xx/xx/xxxxi had had enough and decided to file a complaint against the people in the executive offices because this seemed unbelieveable. i spoke with them on xx/xx/xxxx, thursday, and said it was ridiculous that i cant access my money and that no one is calling me back ( oh and my credit card had expired and they wanted to charge me {$5.00} to send me my new card ). on xx/xx/xxxx, i logged into my account to see if my rent payment had gone through. while i was in my account, i saw the balance for my savings account, which i rarely use or monitor ( i never make payments from this account, only withdrawals or transfers to/from checking ) looked like it had approximately {$4000.00} rather than over {$20000.00}. i clicked on that account and discovered that on xx/xx/xxxx, a little over {$1000.00} had been used to pay a credit card that i dont have, xxxx xxxx online payment. then on the final day, xx/xx/xxxx, that i communicated with chase regarding filing complaints against the managers in executive offices, two more payments were made and labeled, xxxx xxxx online payment, one over {$10000.00} and the other over {$5000.00}. in total, they had stolen over {$17000.00}. i called chase and xxxx kept referring to my checking account and simply said he would send a complaint form. he refused to give me an idea as to what would happen, when i would get my money back, what my rights are, etc. he even insinuated that i had allowed too much time to elapse before report it. what? almost alll of the money had been taken on thursday and i was reporting it just a few days later on xxxx sunday. i had really only missed one business day. do you check you savings account daily? i tried to get information on who the money went to and he refused. i tried to get an estimate on when this would be resolved and he refused. i called xxxx xxxx and they refused to assist because i wouldnt give them an account number or social security number. i dont have an account with xxxx xxxx  and i have never had an account with xxxx xxxx. after what happened, i am not giving out my social security number over a cell phone. i am diligent about not giving it out ever over the phone. i wont even let a doctors office make a copy of my driver license because i am so careful due to potential breaches and stolen identity. for anyone else with chase, i would suggest that you get as far away from them as possible. i dont think it was a coincidence that i was not able to withdrawal my money, in person with photo id, and yet someone without id was able to steal all of my savings by sending it to an account that is not even associated with me. while both banks tried to argue that i might be on someones account and not know or not remember, what they dont know is that i had a credit check done this month that lists all credit cards opened in my name and associated with my social security number. xxxx xxxx does not appear anywhere and i can assure you that i dont even have a credit card with a high enough balance that such large sums would be needed to pay my credit card. i am disgusted with banks. i have lost time from work and i am completely distraught and do not have the money needed to pay my bills.\n"
