    "\n",
    "You need to build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be doing topic modelling on the <b>.json</b> data provided by the company. Since this data is not labelled, you need to apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Credit card / Prepaid card\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bank account services\n",
    "\n",
    "* Theft/Dispute reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mortgages/loans\n",
    "\n",
    "* Others \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of topic modelling, you will be able to map each ticket onto its respective department/category. You can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, you can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department."

( i later found out that since xxxx when i took the loan only {$19.00} was going to my principle. for 15 years, i paid up to {$50000.00} on a loan of {$38000.00} and still owe {$33000.00} ). in xx/xx/xxxx, chase contacted me again expecting me to pay the balance of {$33000.00} by xx/xx/xxxx. following my subsequent call and inquiry to different chase personnel, it was made clear to me that i had a balloon loan. balloon loans are for businesses, they pay low interest rate and generate money to pay off the loan off in a small amount of time. i was also informed that on a loan of {$38000.00} i have paid up to {$50000.00} but only a little less than {$5000.00} went to my principle. the loan is paid off if you ask me but no one asked me. currently, at {$20.00} a month going to my principle, it means i will pay for this loan for the rest of my life, 165 years and to be exact. my loan, for a residential home, had a high interest and is ballooned, very unethical and part i hate the most is the exploitation and misrepresentation chase gave me. chase did not keep the terms of the maturity date change as i was told they would during my xxxx modification. i trusted them that was why i signed everything they gave me with limitedly reading it. so i felt that doing another modification is a way to maneuver me again. chase is not the lien holder of this loan, i did 80/20 and chase got the 20 %. i have demanded to know why only {$20.00} was being paid into my principle, why i paid {$50000.00} to chase and still owe {$33000.00}. what is their plan to have this loan paid off? at {$20.00} a month on a {$33000.00} loan it means it would take 165 years to pay this loan off. this is unethical in all ways and i have asked chase to write off this loan because they got more than enough money from me. they still went ahead to send the modification papers which i have called mr. xxxx to say i would not accept. i hope to get help from you and expose chase if possible. if they did this to me they are doing it to many. i am willing to release any information you need, i will attach, fax or mail documents to you. unlike chase i have nothing to hide. i can authorize them to release all my documents to you, i do not want any privacy with chase. they can not be trusted. thank you. \n",

      "Lower Text to be clear, i am writing this complaint because chase denied me the ability to properly dispute a charge on my credit card which is what they promised to me and all their customers who have a chase freedom unlimited card. at some point in xx/xx/2019 i called chase credit card services at xxxx which is the phone number on the back of my chase freedom unlimited card. i reported to them that there is a charge by xxxx xxxx, a company that services the xxxx land area, for {$1700.00} charged to my account on xx/xx/19 that i would like to dispute. the  chase employee asked why i was disputing the charge. i answered explaining i had been charged for a 36 passenger limo bus which was supposed to arrive on my xx/xx/19 wedding day. i explained on my wedding day xx/xx/xxxx xxxx xxxx arrived in a 22 passenger limo bus which i was forced to use. i explained i would like to be reimbursed the difference in cost of the 36 passenger limo bus and the 22 passenger limo bus. i was assured by the chase employee that they have all the information they required to go forward with the dispute and they would submit my dispute. on xx/xx/19, i received a letter from chase stating they found the charges to be valid and, to my surprise, the letter stated that the \" type of dispute '' recorded by chase was \" cancelled service ( s ) '' ; chase also included documentation submitted from xxxx xxxx employee xxxx xxxx who stated that they did provide services for a 36 pax limo bus ( not true ) and xxxx provided photos from over the hood of the vehicle as well as photos of the locations we visited conveniently hiding the size of the bus ; regardless, the final page of the xx/xx/xxxx letter from chase allows two options : \" i have reviewed the information and the charge ( s ) is  valid. please re-bill my account '' or \" i want to continue my dispute ''. of course, i wanted to continue the dispute and what was most important to me from then on was that chase became aware of the mistake they had made and would then resubmit my dispute with the proper information and have xxxx xxxx provide a response to the proper information. i selected \" i want to continue my dispute '' and i provided an explanation of the dispute as i had previously provided over the phone when i first reported the dispute as well as made them aware of the mistake that that the chase employee had made. i signed and dated this document and on xx/xx/19 faxed it to chase per their instructions to xxxx. i believe it was xx/xx/19 that chase then reapplied the charge of {$1700.00} to my account. that day, i called the same number xxxx to ask about the dispute and was told that they had ruled in favor of xxxx xxxx. i explained then as i am now that i want xxxx xxxx to respond to the proper dispute information i had provided to chase and that was obviously not recorded correctly. i was told i should contact the merchant directly again, give them time to respond, and then resubmit my dispute information via the chase secure message feature on chase.com. i did exactly that. an email was sent to xxxx xxxx with the dispute information and i asked to be reimbursed. xxxx xxxx did not respond. i obtained 2 separate quotes from xxxx xxxx for 9 hours of service of the 22 passenger limousine bus so i can calculate the amount i should be reimbursed. [ [ of note, on the morning of my wedding, i was told by the limousine driver that it was a 22 limousine bus ; i called xxxx xxxx immediately who said they knowingly sent the wrong size bus because the size of my bridal party was 22 ; i explained to the xxxx xxxx employee that i had paid for a 36 passenger bus, that this would create problems, and asked that they drive over the proper size bus ; they explained they could not because all their 36 passenger limo buses were booked for that day ( even though i had booked about a half a year prior ) ; i was told a \" ticket '' would be made to reimburse me. in the days that followed i received a receipt by email from xxxx xxxx for {$1700.00} and never received a call or email regarding reimbursement ] ]. on xx/xx/19, i resubmitted the information as instructed by chase via the secure message feature on chase.com - i attached my email i had sent to xxxx xxxx with my reimbursement demand, the receipt that xxxx xxxx   had sent me, and two documents with quotes i had received from xxxx xxxx  for the 22 passenger limo bus service. today, xx/xx/19, i called chase at the same number i had used previously to ask for an update on the dispute. i was told that they issued a letter today xx/xx/19 stating they did not find the information i provided to be enough to overturn the dispute. i explained again that i was seeking to resubmit my dispute ( to start at step 1 ) with the correct information and to have the merchant respond ( in writing for me to have as a record ) to the correct dispute information and that chase had denied me that opportunity when they recorded the incorrect dispute information and would not correct their mistake ( despite being given by me all the opportunity to do so ) by submitting the correct dispute information to the merchant. the same chase employee added that my re submission request was denied because the documents provided were the same ones provided previously. i asked who had said that? i did not receive a response. i explained that chase is clearly lying to me because it would have been impossible to resubmit the same documents due to the fact that the documents i submitted most recently came into existence after the date of my original dispute submission. i was then transferred to a supervisor named xxxx xxxx at their xxxx xxxx location. the information i provided to xxxx is as i have stated here above. she stated i can not dispute services that i had recieved. i explained i was charged for a 36 passenger bus and received services for a 22 passenger bus i have yet to be charged for. i could not have \" received services '' services of the 36 passenger limo bus because i have never been inside or in the presence of a 36 passenger limo bus. the charge on my card is for a 36 passenger limo bus. i asked xxxx what chase 's overall policy with credit card disputes is in regard to how they value the \" facts '' provide by the merchant as opposed to the \" facts '' provided by the chase credit card customer to which she did not respond. it would appear from my experience that chase sees the information provided by the merchant as \" more true '' than the information provided by the chase credit card customer ; the most important consequence of this is not only have i been denied the opportunity to dispute a charge, but by \" validating '' the merchants information which they based off of incorrect information recorded by a chase employee, they also validate the credibility of the merchant in the event that i file suit against the merchant for a breach of contract or any relevant law suit - the judge in such a case would certainly be swayed by the fact that such a large and well known financial institution such as chase, which otherwise behaves justly in the eyes of the general public, had ruled in favor of the merchant. this would certainly create an obstacle for myself in convincing the judge of the facts in this matter and how i had actually behaved in a true, timely, and just manner and how the merchant had not. furthermore, i explained to xxxx that there would have been ways to avoid this from occurring in the first place such as having their employees that record the disputes be employees who have english as their first/primary language - perhaps the chase employee had become confused because of this and recorded the dispute incorrectly ; i also explained to xxxx that such a large financial institution could certainly afford to add a text box to their dispute template that their employees use that allows those employees to record the details involved in their customers disputes instead of categorizing disputes into broad categories like \" cancelled service ( s ) '' - xxxx would not confirm whether they do or don't have this ability. i would add that, if phone reported disputes at chase have known accuracy issues, such a large financial institution can certainly implement a policy of confirming dispute information with the chase credit card customer in writing via email or chase.com or mail or fax and that they will not submit the dispute information until the customer has confirmed that their dispute was recorded correctly after viewing it in writing - had this been done i would not be writing this long complaint and i would have corrected the the incorrectly recorded dispute information before it was sent by chase to the merchant. finally, i don't expect a merchant who showed such lack of morality on the day of my wedding to admit to their wrong doing now - i expect i will have to file suit against them but i need a proper credit card dispute process to start and finish before i can do that. i hope you can do what i am asking without creating an even bigger mess for me. this is not enjoyable.\n",

      "Lower Text back in xx/xx/xxxx, my husband and i got in touch with chase bank via telephone to inquire and see if we would be eligible to cancel our private mortgage insurance. when we initially signed our loan documents with our mortgage lender back on xx/xx/xxxx, the terms of the loan were that we had the right to request the pmi be canceled once the principal balance reaches 80 % of the original value of the property ( please see attached document labeled pmi ). with the updates we have done on our home and the market in our area, we believed we would be in a good position to reach that 80 %. <p/>thus we contacted chase to start this process. we are in good standing with our loan in that there has never been a late payment and each month we pay an additional {$180.00} to our principal balance. on xx/xx/xxxx, chase sent us a document outlining how we start the process of requesting to cancel our pmi ( please see attached document labeled chase page 1 ). the first step in the process was to request a broker price opinion, which is what we did. on xx/xx/xxxx, chase sent us a document stating they received the signed bpo request form and ordered the bpo. a few days later we heard from the third party bpo agent, and the bpo was conducted on monday, xx/xx/xxxx. <p/>on xx/xx/xxxx, we received a letter from chase stating they can not cancel our pmi because our loan-to-value ( ltv ) ratio for this loan must be 75 % or below to cancel our pmi based on the current or newly appraised value of the property ( please see attached chase document page 3 ).  they stated that currently our ltv ratio is 78.57 %. they advised that to meet this new 75 % ltv requirement, we would need to pay down the principal to {$290000.00}. the amount we would owe is approximately {$14000.00}, and this is not something my husband and i are financially able to commit to right now. <p/>after receiving this letter, i contacted chase to see if there was any documentation i signed agreeing to these new loan terms regarding the 75 % ltv ratio. chase did not have anything on file. the only documents they had on file regarding our pmi agreement, is the original document we signed back on xx/xx/xxxx ( attached pmi document ) stating that we were held to the 80 % ltv ratio. <p/>i am filing this complaint because i feel like we have been faithful in our payments, and we have met the terms on our loan making us eligible to cancel our pmi by meeting the 80 % ltv requirement. we are currently at 78.57 %. i am happy to answer any questions or elaborate on any of these points. thank you very much for your time and i appreciate your assistance with this matter.\n",

'' this meant that they did not thoroughly look at the documentation that they requested from me ( ca vehicle registration and ca insurance ). i followed up based on this letter and they asked me to resend them everything i had already sent, so i did. then i received a letter on xx/xx/xxxx that said : \" thank you for contacting us about property tax on the lease account above. in order to assist you, we need additional documents. please send a copy of this letter and information shown below as soon as possible : other : please provide a copy of your current registration and a copy of your insurance card ... sincerely, lease retail services representative '' i received a second letter also dated xx/xx/xxxx that said : \" i am writing to you concerning the above referenced lease. per our call to xxxx xxxx, va, the customer may have registered in xxxx xxxx, va, but they live in xxxx xxxx, va. xxxx xxxx does not border xxxx xxxx from any direction. xxxx xxxx notified  xxxx xxxx so the property tax billing would be received from the correct jurisdiction. the bill is valid for the residential and garaging address ... sincerely, title research representative.

'' the borrower for the above referenced account was in default on his monthly payments and applied for a loan modification. via letter dated xx/xx/2018 chase approved the borrower for a loan modification. that approval was received on xx/xx/2018. attached hereto as exhibit a is a copy of the approval. the approval included a fedex label, which indicated that something needed to be returned to chase. my office reached out to chase and was told that the signature page of the trial modification was not included, but because the matter was being litigated no further information could be provided and that it was necessary to contact chases attorney. thereafter, on xx/xx/2018 my office contacted chases attorneys office requesting a complete trial modification so that it could be signed and sent back to chase, at which point chases attorneys office replied that trial modification should require no signatures, simply that they make their first payment within the timeframe indicated so we should be all set. ( emphasis added ). see the email communications between my office and chases attorney attached as exhibit b. \n",
      "thereafter, the borrower timely made both his first and second trial payments as required. then, on xx/xx/2018 plaintiffs attorney forwarded a letter dated xx/xx/2018 to my office which was a trial approval requiring a signature, it appears that the xx/xx/2018 letter had originally been sent to the borrowers prior attorney. attached hereto as exhibit c is a copy of the xx/xx/2018 email. then, on xx/xx/2018 the borrower received a letter, dated xx/xx/2018, stating that the modification had been terminated because the borrower failed to timely return the signed trial plan. attached hereto as exhibit d is a copy of that letter. on xx/xx/2018, after communicating with chases attorney, the borrower returned the signed trial plan, which had only been received five days before, and requested chase honor the loan modification offer. then, the borrower attempted to make the xx/xx/2018 trial payment, but that payment was rejected for not being in certified funds, and then when the borrower sent the money in certified funds, it was again rejected by chase. see returned payment attached hereto as exhibit e. \n",
      "after additional communication the borrower was informed, in xx/xx/2018, that chase would honor the loan modification provided the borrower made the xxxx, xxxx and xxxx payments in one lump sum. attached hereto as exhibit f is a copy of the email directing such payment. however, the borrower was unsure of where to send the payment, he requested wiring instructions or for chase to take the payment over the telephone, but that could not be done, and therefore the borrower was unable to send the payment until xx/xx/2018 which is when he learned of the correct address. attached hereto as exhibit g is a copy of the payment. chase rejected this payment too. attached hereto as exhibit h is a copy of the rejection. \n",
      "thereafter, the borrower was advised by chases attorney that his best course of action was to apply for another loan modification, which was thereafter denied by chase. attached hereto as exhibit i is a copy of the denial letter. a foreclosure sale has now been scheduled for the borrowers home. attached hereto as exhibit j is a copy of the notice of sale. \n",
      "the actions of chase in this action have been totally improper. this is a fha loan and is therefore insured by hud, which means that if the loan suffers a loss, hud will need to pay a claim. because this is a government insured loan, chase was required to take those appropriate action which can reasonably be expected to generate the smallest financial loss to the department pursuant to 12 c.f.r. 203.501. here, the borrower demonstrated not only an ability to pay the loan, but a willingness to do so as well. moreover, it is clear that the only cause of the alleged default with respect to the proposed modification was as a result of certain communication breakdowns, and not due to any inability to reluctance to pay. in fact, it should be noted that the borrower tendered each and every payment that came due, which payments were either accepted or made in certified funds, thereby showing that the modification was possible. \n",
      "by refusing to honor the loan modification, chase has created a situation wherein the borrower stands to be harmed, through the loss of his home, hud stands to be harmed by potentially paying out a claim that it would not need to pay but for chases refusal to honor the modification, while chase will suffer no harm as it is fully insured by hud. this is in clear violation of 12 c.f.r. 203.501 and would appear to be in bad faith, and is against the public policy of new york. \n",
      "therefore, in light of chase, and its attorneys, repeated malfeasance or nonfeasance, as the case may be, wherein the borrower was told explicitly that no signature was necessary for the trial modification, when chase did require such a signature, chases rejection of trial payments despite agreeing to honor the modification, chases failure to timely provide a mailing address for a three month lump sum trial payment, and then chases rejection of that payment, after informing the borrower that such payment would be accepted, you should find that chase has acted improperly and therefore mete out any punishment deemed appropriate for its handling of this matter.\n",

      "then, we called a few days before my xx/xx/xxxx rent was due, because my account still reflected the unpaid balance. we discussed it over the phone and they told us that the funds would be delivered within 72 hours at the latest. we called on the xx/xx/xxxx because my property manager stated that the company still had not received funds. we were told that the funds were posted that day at xxxx. but that was still not reflected in my account. \n",

      "then in xxxxxxxx i received a notification from my rental company that chase had pulled out the amounts that were payed in xxxxxxxx they did not mention the payments for xxxxxxxx just xxxxxxxx i immediately called chase to ask what was going on and they stated that the payment had been sent to the merchant already and they instructed us to wait a few days for it to post to their accounts we waited and they still did not notify us of them having received any money and my account still reflected the pastdue balance for the month of xxxxxxxx so we called again to have the money sent over and were told to wait the merchant still had nt received payment so we called again and another time after that even after all those times they still had not received the money \n",
      "\n",
      "then we called a few days before my xxxxxxxx rent was due because my account still reflected the unpaid balance we discussed it over the phone and they told us that the funds would be delivered within  hours at the latest we called on the xxxxxxxx because my property manager stated that the company still had not received funds we were told that the funds were posted that day at xxxx but that was still not reflected in my account \n",
      "\n",
      "when we called again on xxxxxxxx we were then told that the merchant had received the payment but it would take an additional  hours for them to process the payment so that it could reflect on my account however my rent for the month of xxxxxxxx was already past due at this point because i was unable to pay for it due to the balance that was still owed for xxxxxxxx which prompted the company to close off my ability to make payments through their online portal \n",
      "\n",
      "finally we called today  xxxxxxxx  to see if we could just get the credit for the payments added back onto the credit card so i could make the payment myself  i had spoken to the property manager and they agreed to unlock my account for online payment just this once  we were told that it was not possible to do so but would have to wait until the xxxx for the money to be posted however i was already given notice that the rent had to be paid in full  xxxxxxxx and xxxxxxxx plus the late fees  by the xxxx or i would be forced to vacate the premises i informed them of this and of the situation that led up to this and they stated that they could not help me i persisted and got transferred two or three times to higherlevel staff until one of the staff members decided to get into contact with the accounting department to see if she could cancel the merchant repayment and just put the credit back on the card  which would take an additional  hours  we saw that it would be our best option and opted for her to do so and they approved it \n",
      "\n",
      "however during the twomonth period that it took to finally get this issue semiresolved my rental account had acquired over xxxx in late fees and chase is stating that they refuse to pay for it they stated that we could have just paid the funds ourselves and just asked the money to be credited on the account that is false because due to the company pulling the money from the merchant they locked all online access to the account and when we did try to get the money credited to our account it took over an hour of arguing over the phone just for them to agree to do so also the accumulation of all of these late fees is solely due to the length of time that it took for the company to send the money back to the merchant  which still has nt happened by the way  money for two charges that we did not even authorize to be taken out of the account in the first place my mother had originally called to dispute a charge that was made in xxxxxxxx not the two payments made in xxxxxxxx \n",
      "\n",
      "every time that we called to request the money be sent back to the merchant we were guaranteed that they would receive it under a specified time frame and all of those statements were false chase is denying all responsibility for this issue and states that the late fees are our responsibility and that their sole responsibility is to return the funds to the merchant however they have failed to even do the thing that they claim responsibility for my mother and i are very frustrated and feel very cheated and taken advantage of we are also discussing pursuing legal action and not because of the late fees but for the fact that it took such a lengthy amount of time to just send back two payments  which they did not even do  and for not owning up to their responsibility in the matter if it were not for the kindheartedness of my current property manager i would have been evicted and charged even more money in late fees chase needs to acknowledge their wrongdoing in this situation and own up to it\n",
